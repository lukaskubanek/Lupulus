# Lupulus

Lupulus is my custom keyboard layout which is suited for writing texts in Czech, German and English languages, combined with programming and working in Terminal. It's created using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) and is meant to be used with Mac keyboard having US English layout:
