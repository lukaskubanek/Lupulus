# Lupulus

Lupulus<sup id="a1">[\[1\]](#f1)</sup> is my custom keyboard layout designed for writing in Czech, German, and English, while also being optimized for programming and Terminal work. It includes custom mappings for special characters like `…`, `←`, `→`, `↔︎`, `✓`, `✗`, `×` and more, making them easily accessible without relying on text replacements, which don’t work reliably in IDEs or web-based apps.

The layout was created using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) and is intended for use with Mac keyboards with a US English layout.
