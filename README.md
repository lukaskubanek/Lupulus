# Lupulus

Lupulus<sup id="a1">[\[1\]](#f1)</sup> is my custom keyboard layout designed for writing in Czech, German, and English, while also being optimized for programming and Terminal work. It includes custom mappings for special characters like `…`, `←`, `→`, `↔︎`, `✓`, `✗`, `×` and more, making them easily accessible without relying on text replacements, which don’t work reliably in IDEs or web-based apps.

The layout was created using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) and is intended for use with Mac keyboards with a US English layout:

## Installation

The keyboard layout can be installed directly from Ukelele by selecting *File > Install > Show Organizer*, navigating to the repository directory in the *Not Installed* column, right-clicking the layout, and choosing *Install for Current User*. After installation, log out and log back in to apply the changes.

## Icon Licensing

The keyboard layout icon is licensed via Flaticon Premium (unlimited use without attribution).
